## AWS Microservice System Project

This repository contains the implementation of a scalable microservice architecture designed to run on AWS. The project aims to provide a robust foundation for building cloud-native applications following modern best practices.

## Project Structure

- `Requirements.md`: Detailed requirements specification for the system
- `infrastructure/`: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files for AWS resources
- `services/`: Individual microservice implementations
- `docs/`: Project documentation, architecture diagrams, and guides
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development and deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured locally
- Docker installed
- [Other prerequisites to be determined]

### Development Setup
[To be specified based on technology stack decisions]

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservice architecture pattern deployed on AWS, utilizing:

- Container orchestration for service management
- API Gateway for unified API access
- Event-driven communication for async operations
- Infrastructure as Code for deployment
- CI/CD for automated testing and deployment

See `Requirements.md` for detailed specifications.
