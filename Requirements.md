# AWS Microservice System Requirements

## Project Overview
- Project Name: sbxservice
- Description: A scalable, cloud-native microservice architecture on AWS
- Purpose: [Client to specify the business purpose]

## Functional Requirements
1. Service Components
   - User Management Service
   - Authentication/Authorization Service
   - API Gateway
   - Data Processing Service
   - Reporting/Analytics Service
   - [Other domain-specific services as needed]

2. Features
   - RESTful API endpoints for all services
   - Inter-service communication
   - Asynchronous processing capabilities
   - Data persistence
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Logging and tracing
   - [Additional features specific to business needs]

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Microservice-based architecture
- Event-driven communication patterns where appropriate
- API-first design approach
- Domain-driven design principles

### Infrastructure (AWS)
- Compute: AWS ECS or EKS (container orchestration)
- Serverless: AWS Lambda for specific functions
- API Management: API Gateway
- Storage:
  - Relational Database: RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
  - NoSQL Database: DynamoDB
  - Object Storage: S3
- Messaging: SQS, SNS, or EventBridge
- Caching: ElastiCache
- CDN: CloudFront (if public-facing components exist)
- DNS: Route 53
- Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer

### Security
- IAM for resource access control
- Secrets Manager for credentials
- VPC for network isolation
- Security Groups for firewall rules
- WAF for API protection
- SSL/TLS for all communications
- OAuth2/OIDC for authentication

### DevOps
- CI/CD Pipeline using AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform or AWS CDK
- Containerization with Docker
- Monitoring with CloudWatch
- Logging with CloudWatch Logs
- Tracing with X-Ray
- Alerting through SNS

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling for all services
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for all critical services
- Performance: API response times under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Disaster Recovery: RPO < 1 hour, RTO < 4 hours
- Compliance: [Client to specify regulatory requirements]

## Development Guidelines
- Programming Languages: [Preferred languages - e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, Go]
- API Specification: OpenAPI/Swagger
- Code Quality: Static analysis, unit testing, integration testing
- Documentation: Architecture diagrams, API documentation, runbooks

## Deployment Environments
- Development
- Testing/QA
- Staging
- Production

## Future Considerations
- [List any potential future integrations or expansions]

## Timeline
- [Client to specify project phases and deadlines]

## Budget Constraints
- [Client to specify budget limitations]

## Success Criteria
- [Client to define key performance indicators]
